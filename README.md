# Password-Generator

The project presented here was an assignment to create a javascript file that would generate a
random password given certain criteria that the user includes. The password criteria must
contain one of the following: Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters, Special charactors and 
Numbers. The password must also be a minimum of 8 charactors or a max of 128 charactors. The file itself contains a list of charactors, conditional statements, fuctions and if statements. 
The styling that was given thru the css file was only mildly altered as well as the html file. 
This was a good way to implement some of the fundamentals and that have been learned thus far
thru the program.
